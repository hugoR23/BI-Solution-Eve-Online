# BI-Solution-Eve-Online
This project is a full BI Solution for merchant to manage their stock on Eve Online.
The result of the project is a dashboard to provide information on :
 * What product to sell, when and at what price ?
 * What product to buy and when ?
 * KPI on the merchant business (revenue, profit, cost...)

It relies on the following software :
 * Node.Js
 * Talend Open Studio
 * SQL Server Data Tools
 * Microsoft 
 * Tableau Software

The documentation to set up the tool is available in the [user guide](https://github.com/hugoR23/BI-Solution-Eve-Online/blob/master/Guide_d_installation.pdf) (in French for now...)
